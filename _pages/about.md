I am a junior pursuing a BS in Mathematics and (tentatively) an MS in Computer Science at Stanford University, minoring in Economics. I currently work on mechanism design with [Prof. Ravi Jagadeesan](https://sites.google.com/site/ravijagadeesan/) and reinforcement learning and direct preference optimization with [Prof. Vasilis Syrgkanis](https://vsyrgkanis.com/). Previously, I have interned at [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/) and done research with the [ASSISTments Lab](https://new.assistments.org/) and [MIT PRIMES](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/). I graduated from the [Massachusetts Academy of Math & Science at WPI](https://www.massacademy.org/) in 2022.

Generally, I am interested in applying mathematics to problems in computer science, economics, and their intersections. I am also a classical pianist and cellist. Please email me at kvseet17 'at' stanford 'edu' if you'd like to chat or collaborate!
